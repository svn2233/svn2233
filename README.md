# 💫 About Me:
Hi there 👋, I'm Steven Nguyen, an Informatics Analyst currently working in the medical field. 

With years of experience in data analysis, my journey began when I started learning about data analysis and building PowerBI dashboards during the 2020 lockdown. Quickly becoming the go-to guy for the entire New York Sales Team at Monster Energy for developing PowerBI dashboards and presentations for the team. 

I specialize in leveraging data insights for strategic decision-making and operational efficiency. Excelling in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and certified in Google Data Analytics, Google Business Intelligence, Salesforce Sales Operations, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI, I'm committed to driving results through data-driven recommendations and collaborative problem-solving.

My journey has equipped me with the expertise to transform data into actionable insights for impactful outcomes.
