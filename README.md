# üí´ About Me:
  Hi there üëã, My name is Steven Nguyen a Data Analyst specializing in SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. I hold certificates in Google Data Analytics, Google Business Intelligence, and Salesforce Sales Operations and many more. 
  
  I am proficient in analyzing sales, revenue, costs, customer trends, and KPIs, creating interactive Tableau and Power BI dashboards for actionable insights for senior leadership. Throughout my career, I've consistently achieved remarkable results through data-driven recommendations. 
  
  At my current job, I not only secured a substantial 15% increase in monthly sales but also contributed to a remarkable 52% increase in employee morale and an impressive 38% boost in productivity, all driven by a data-backed business plan. In my previous role, I leveraged data analytics to orchestrate a remarkable turnaround in my sales territory, transforming it from a concerning -18% decline to a thriving 15% year-over-year growth!
